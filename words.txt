The worst part about prison was the demontors.;I talk a lot, so I've learned to just tune myself out...;I am Beyonce always.;I am running away from my responsibilities and it feels good.;And I feel God in this Chili's tonight.;Dwight mercy-killed Angela's cat.;I'm not superstitious, but I am a little stitious;Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year.
